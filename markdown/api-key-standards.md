# API Key Secret Reporting Policy

## Firebase API Keys
- Firebase API keys are safe to be public. You may include them in your code repositories without concerns for security.

## Other API Keys
- Any other API keys, such as those from Hugging Face, should be reported immediately if exposed publicly. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of your applications.

> Note: Please do not confuse this policy with Google Apps Script deployment URLs, which follow a different security guideline.
